<h2>Exercise</h2>

{{#code-block}}
  ember install ember-perf-timeline
{{/code-block}}

<p>
  We are rendering a component that is super slow and causes performance issues. We should investigate this.
  Make sure your app is running then navigate to:
  <code>
    <a href="http://localhost:4200/render/ember-perf-timeline?_ember-perf-timeline=true">
      http://localhost:4200/render/ember-perf-timeline?_ember-perf-timeline=true
    </a>
  </code>
</p>

<p>
  Now open your Chrome DevTools and go to the Performance Tab. Let's reload the page and record our
  performance. Once we have the results, we can look at the <code>User Timing</code> section and you should
  notice there is a really long section with a title like <code>render.ember-perf-timeline:main (Rendering: outlet)</code>.
  This is our slow component holding up the outlet from rendering. We can scroll down to the main section and look
  at the call stack, and you will see the <code>init</code> call is holding us up for several seconds.
</p>

<p>
  If we go inspect our slow component, you can see that it does some crazy stuff and changes the height 10,000
  times. This is probably not a very real world example, but you can see this allows you to easily pinpoint where
  things are going wrong.
</p>

<p>
  The expensive part here is the actual measuring of the height. We can see by looking at the code it keeps
  measuring <code>newDiv.clientHeight</code> and adding one to it. Each time we measure it causes a force layout, so
  if we just add 10,000 to the height at once instead and do not measure it will resolve this.

  // components/slow-component/component.js
  newDiv.style.height = '10000px';
