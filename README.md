# Ember Performance Workshop

## Setup

We will be starting with Ember 3.0 to automatically get the ~10 kb savings the removal of deprecations gives us. 
I have setup this example app and added some bloated and non-performant things to it. 
I highly recommend following along with the official repo and just making these changes in your other apps later, 
but if you would like to try to work in a different app, feel free to, but we may not be able to offer as much support if things go wrong.

## Things to install

    npm install -g lighthouse
    npm install -g broccoli-concat-analyser

## Exercises

The steps and exercises live in the app itself. If you would like to refer to something deployed, you
can head to [https://ember-performance-workshop.netlify.com/](https://ember-performance-workshop.netlify.com/) to
see the app deployed, before any changes or exercises have been completed. The steps live on the pages there.
